curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doubleleft/hook/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

At the end of the process you should have

How to use
---

Run the server locally:

```
hook server
```

Create a new application from the commandine:

```
hook app:new my-app --endpoint http://0.0.0.0:4665
```

It will output access keys to use in the front-end. Checkout this example using
[JavaScript](https://github.com/doubleleft/hook-javascript#how-to-use) frontend.

Take a look at the [documentation](http://doubleleft.github.io/hook-userguide/) for
more details.
